5.  Copy the topic **ARN** for the next task.

## Subscribe to Sigfox Topic

To receive messages published to a topic, you have to subscribe an endpoint to that topic. An endpoint is a mobile app, web server, email address, or an Amazon SQS queue that can receive notification messages from Amazon SNS. Once you subscribe an endpoint to a topic and the subscription is confirmed, the endpoint will receive all messages published to that topic.

In this section you subscribe an endpoint to the topic you just created in the previous section. You configure the subscription to send the topic messages to your email account.

**To subscribe to a topic**

1.  Open the Amazon SNS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v2/home).

2.  Click **Create subscription**.

    The **Create Subscription** dialog box appears.

3.  In the **Topic ARN** field, paste the topic ARN you created in the previous task, for example: `arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:111122223333:MyTopic`.

4.  In the **Protocol** drop-down box, select **Email**.

5.  In the **Endpoint** box, type an email address you can use to receive the notification.

    <div class="aws-note">
