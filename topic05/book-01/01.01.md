# Send data from Sigfox to AWS IoT

In a previous lab you connected objects to the Sigfox network. In this lab you will configure the native AWS IoT connector to push your data to the AWS Cloud. To make things a bit more interesting, we will use AWS Simple Notification Service to publish the data and subscribe a SMS service

![Fig1](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f6e1126cedebf23e1463aee73f9df08783640400/2017/02/15/Fig1-1.jpg)

In order to implement this architecture, we are going to perform the following steps:

*   Configure the AWS IoT Connector in the Sigfox Console
*   Provision the necessary resources on AWS so Sigfox can send data into your AWS account securely through the AWS IoT connector using a CloudFormation script that will generate IAM roles and permissions.
*   Manually create a rule in AWS IoT and a SNS topic so we can publish the data coming from Sigfox

In our example, we are using the EU-West-01 region. Once you gain knowledge on how to configure the different pieces, then customize the implementation to fit your needs.

First, log into the [Sigfox console](https://backend.sigfox.com/auth/login), go to the _“Callbacks”_ section and click on the _“New”_ button to create a new “_Callback”_.

Now select the _“AWS IoT”_ option as the type of _“Callback”._

Please copy the “_External Id”_ given to you in your clipboard, it will be useful later. The “_External Id”_ is unique to your account and enables greater security when authorizing third party to access your AWS resources, you can find more information [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

Next click on _“Launch Stack”_ and leave the _“CROSS_ACCOUNT”_ option selected.

This will redirect you to the AWS CloudFormation console, click _“Next”_ on the first screen.

![Fig5](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f6e1126cedebf23e1463aee73f9df08783640400/2017/02/15/Fig5.png)

On the following screen, enter the following inputs:

*   _Stack name:_ Choose a meaningful name for the connector.
*   _AWSAccountId:_ Input your AWS Account Id, [you can find it here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html).
*   _External Id:_ Copy/paste the external Id given to you in the Sigfox console.
*   _Region:_ Choose EU-West Region
*   _Topic Name:_ Choose the topic name you wish to send data to.

Click _“Next”_ once you are ready.

The next screen is optional, if you wish you can customize options (Tags, Permissions, Notifications) otherwise click on _“Next”_ to continue with the default options. You should now be on the review screen, check the _“I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources”  _box and click on _“Create”_ to launch the CloudFormation stack.

After a few minutes the provisioning should be completed.

After selecting the AWS CloudFormation stack, click on the _“Outputs”_ tab and copy the value for the _“ARNRole”_ key, the _“Region”_ key and the _“Topic”_ key.

![Fig8](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f6e1126cedebf23e1463aee73f9df08783640400/2017/02/15/Fig8.jpg)

Go Back to the Sigfox console and paste the values you copied from the _“Output”_ section of the AWS CloudFormation stack. Please also fill out the _“Json Body”_ field in the Sigfox console. This JSON represents the payload that will be sent to AWS IoT using the native connector and contains the payload from the connected device as well as some metadata. This is a point for future customization using the Sigfox documentation if you wish to do so.

<pre>{
  "device" : "{device}",
  "data" : "{data}",
  "time" : "{time}",
  "snr" : "{snr}",
  "station" : "{station}",
  "avgSnr" : "{avgSnr}",
  "lat" : "{lat}",
  "lng" : "{lng}",
  "rssi" : "{rssi}",
  "seqNumber" : "{seqNumber}"
}</pre>

Finally, click _“Ok”_.

You now have successfully created your callback and can visualize the data sent to it.

Now that the data is being sent to AWS IoT via the native connector, we will create an AWS IoT Rule to store the data into an Amazon DynamoDB table.
