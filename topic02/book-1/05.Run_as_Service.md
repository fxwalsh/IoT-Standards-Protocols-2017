## Run as a Service
You will want the beacon to start when you reboot the pi. 
ÃŒn /etc/init.d/ create a file called `beacon` with the following contents:

```
#!/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:$PATH

DESC="Beacon Application Software"
PIDFILE=/var/run/beacon.pid
SCRIPTNAME=/etc/init.d/beacon

case "$1" in
  start)
    printf "%-50s" "Starting beacon..."
    cd /home/pi/beacon
    sudo ./beacon_start
    ;;
  stop)
    printf "%-50s" "Stopping beacon..."
    cd /home/pi/beacon
    sudo ./beacon_stop
    ;;
  restart)
    $0 stop
   $0 start
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
    exit 1
esac
```

Now make the file executable by running the following command as the sudo user:
```
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/beacon
```


We want the beacon to run as a service. We can use `update-rc.d` to register the service and configure it to start when the pi boots, and stop when it shuts down. Run the following to do this. 

```
sudo update-rc.d beacon start 80 2 3 4 5 . stop 30 0 1 6 .
```
