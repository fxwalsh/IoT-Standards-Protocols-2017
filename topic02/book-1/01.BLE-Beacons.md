#Bluetooth Low Energy 

## Raspberry Pi as a Beacon

Beacons are one-way transmitters that are used to mark important places and objects. Standards are emerging in the beacon space, including Apple's iBeacon and Google's Eddystone beacon platform. 
A beacon is detectable to a user's device from a range of a few meters, using Bluetooth Low Energy to provide contextual information to devices and applications. 
In this lab we will use a Raspberry Pi to create a beacon.
