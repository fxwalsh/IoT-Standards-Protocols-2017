## Set up Beacon

You can use hciconfig and hcitool to configure Bluetooth devices. We will create the following to make the pi act as a beacon:
- A start script
- A stop script
- A config file

- On your pi create the directory  `/home/pi/beacon`
- In `/home/pi/beacon`, create a file called `beacon.conf` and add the following contents:

```
#BLE beacon configuration
export BLUETOOTH_DEVICE=hci0
export UUID="e2 c5 6d b5 df fb 48 d2 b0 60 d0 f5 a7 10 96 e0"
export MAJOR="00 16"
export MINOR="00 08"
export POWER="c5"
```

- In the same folder, create a file called `beacon_start` with the following contents
```
#!/bin/sh
. ./beacon.conf
echo "Launching virtual beacon..."
sudo hciconfig $BLUETOOTH_DEVICE up
sudo hciconfig $BLUETOOTH_DEVICE noleadv
sudo hciconfig $BLUETOOTH_DEVICE leadv 0
sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 1e 02 01 1a 1a ff 4c 00 02 15 $UUID $MAJOR $MIN
echo "Complete"
```

- In the same folder, create a file called `beacon_stop` with the following contents

```
#!/bin/sh
. ./beacon.conf
echo "Disabling virtual iBeacon..."
sudo hciconfig $BLUETOOTH_DEVICE noleadv
echo "Complete"
```

### Turn the beacon on
- Run the start script as sudo and you should see the beacon. Using your smart phone, download a free beacon locator. You should see the beacon and an indication of it's proximity.
