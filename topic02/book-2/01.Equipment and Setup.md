##You need the following tools:

- A Raspberry Pi 3 development board - with super user access. 
- iOS / Android phone with BLE support
- Evothings Studio software 

## Configure Bluetooth on the Pi
The Raspberry Pi 3 will be running a Node.js application that makes use of the Bleno library. This library requires that you have installed the Bluetooth stack, Bluez. Bluez is pre-installed in the latest releases of Raspbian. To check that Bluez is installed and which version. Do this by running the following command: 
```
hcitool | grep ver
```
This command should return the version number, typically 5.* . If this is not successfull, install blueZ as follows:
```
sudo apt-get install pi-bluetooth
```
For Bleno to work, you need to stop the bluetooth daemon. The following commands will stop and check the status:
```
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```
Verify that the status is dead.
Now make this permenant by running the following command:
```
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
```
You also need to power up the Bluetooth adapter after stopping the bluetooth daemon. 
```
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```
