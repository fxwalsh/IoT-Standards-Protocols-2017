## Writing code for the SiPy 

Connect your SiPy to your computer and launch Atom and start the pyMkr add on.

Create a new file called *hello_world.py* and enter the following code

~~~python
from network import Sigfox
import socket
 
# init Sigfox for RCZ1 (Europe) 
sigfox = Sigfox(mode=Sigfox.SIGFOX, rcz=Sigfox.RCZ1) 
 
# create a Sigfox socket 
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_SIGFOX, socket.SOCK_RAW)
 
# make the socket blocking 
s.setblocking(True) 
 
# configure it as uplink only 
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SIGFOX, socket.SO_RX, False) 
 
# send some bytes 
s.send("Hello World")
~~~


##Check for messages
You should now be able to see your message on the Sigfox Backend. Go to [](https://backend.sigfox.com), login and click on the 'Device' tab. You should see your SiPy in the list below; click on it's ID and then select the 'Messages' tab at the side.

You'll see a string of hexadecimal numbers. Sigfox automatically decodes your message as raw hexadecimal so your message "Hello World" should look something like "48656C6C6F20576F726C64".

Open the "Device Type" tab and choose the "Pycom Kit". You'll be presented with an information screen. Find an "Edit" button. Under "Display", you can choose to set the type as String; this will turn your messy hexadecimal message into a more readable ASCII message.
