Look at the code in the last page. You will notice that you can configure the tmp102 sensor with an upper and lower bound for the temperature. The alert pin can be used to detect if the temperature is outside this range. Modify the program to display a suitable message/colour on the LCD if the predifined temp range is not satisfied.
